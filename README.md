gems_graphics
=============
This is a graphics homework project that I designed to create a screen producing random gems. Upon clicking a gem, the application uses Breadth-First Search to find a path of the same gems. If the path is >4 gems long, the application removes the path, drops down the gems above it, and fills in the empty space with randomly generated gems.

The application uses OpenGL to produce the images.

To Do (beyond the homework assignment):
	Add a points system
